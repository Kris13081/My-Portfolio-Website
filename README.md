# My-Portfolio-Website

I am proud to introduce my latest project, a comprehensive and visually appealing portfolio website that showcases some of my frontend skills and experience as a web developer. The site features five main sections: Home, About Me, Portfolio, My Blogs, and Contact Me.

The Home page of my portfolio website serves as an introduction to who I am and my goals as a web developer. It provides a brief overview of my background, education, and experience, and sets the tone for the rest of the site. The About Me section provides insight into my background, education, and experience, while the Portfolio section showcases my projects and my certificates. The Favorite Blogs section showcases my passion for staying up-to-date with industry news and trends, and the Contact Me section allows visitors to get in touch with me for potential projects or collaborations.

I have used HTML5, CSS3, and a little bit of JavaScript to bring this website to life. I also utilized the modern Visual Studio Code extension SCSS, which is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS and allows for easier, more efficient styling. As I am currently learning JavaScript, I have only used it for some simple, yet effective, enhancements to the website.

Overall, this portfolio website serves as a testament to my skills and commitment to quality in web development. I invite you to explore the site and see for yourself what I have to offer as a developer. Thank you for visiting and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
